## Project Context

This project was done one the project proposal provided by FAST-NU University to the students studying Object Oriented programming in Spring 22.
All the modules & validations were applied taking that project proposal as a reference. This project was supposed to be done on C++ using binary file handling, whereas this code represents Java implementation & serialization of objects using Java IO.

PS: The approaches or limitations such as complexities were not mentioned on proposal. We used Hashmaps<> explicitly in making of this project which covers data structures aspect as well.
